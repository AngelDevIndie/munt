drvsetup
========
A helper tool capable of installing / upgrading the Windows driver mt32emu_win32drv and registering
in the system (in some non-standard way which may fail occasionally).

infinstall
==========
A helper tool intended to make simple the standard tedious way of the mt32emu_win32drv MIDI Windows
driver installation using the .inf file. It doesn't attempt to deal with the default Windows driver
signing policy, but only eliminates the need to use all those boring wizards for manual
installation of non-PnP devices on Windows.
